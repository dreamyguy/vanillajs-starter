Sometimes it's nice to prototype locally **without all the bloat**. If that's what you're after, this repo has got you covered. ✨

This project outputs production-optimised `javascript` to a folder called `dist`. The resulting file, called `main.js` is compiled out of the [index.js][3] file, which is the main source.

**You can use ES6 syntax**, do imports of local helpers, utilities, frameworks or modules introduced through `npm`. The sky is the limit, _but here you get started with the bare minimum setup._

## Development

### Getting started

Clone this repo locally. You'll need to have [NodeJS][1] installed. Install all dependencies by running:

    npm i

### Run it locally

To start the app locally, run:

    npm run dev

This command fires up the application on port `9889`, making it visible on http://localhost:9889.

Every time you make changes to [index.js][3], your page will refresh and reflect the changes.

### Building for production

When you're satisfied with your script and ready to build for production, run:

     npm run build

This command compiles the production-optimised `javascript` to `main.js`, a file compiled out of [index.js][3].

When your script is ready, you may use it in other pages by doing the usual script inclusion:

```html
<script src="/path/to/js/renamed-to-your-discretion.min.js"></script>
<script>
  yourAwesomeFunction({
    so: 'much',
    wow: 'zee'
  });
</script>
```

You may rename the compiled file to your liking and start referring to your functions, objects, arrays, variables - or whatever it was you defined in your script.

Remember to do some sensible checks, like the vanilla js equivalent to jQuery's _"on document ready"_:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // document has finished loading
}
```
